## Security First Philosophy

At M.O.N.K.Y, security isn't an afterthought‚Äîit's built into every layer of our architecture. We understand that in the world of digital assets, security is paramount. That's why we've implemented military-grade security measures to protect your funds and personal information.

<Card title="üõ°Ô∏è Zero-Knowledge Architecture" icon="shield-check">
  Your private keys never leave your device. M.O.N.K.Y operates on a zero-knowledge basis, meaning we cannot access your funds even if we wanted to.
</Card>

## Core Security Features

### üîê **256-bit Encryption**

All sensitive data is protected using AES-256 encryption, the same standard used by government agencies and military organizations worldwide.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Data at Rest" icon="database">
    Private keys and sensitive data are encrypted before being stored locally on your device.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data in Transit" icon="network-wired">
    All communications are secured with TLS 1.3 encryption and certificate pinning.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### üîë **Local Key Management**

<Warning>
**Your keys, your crypto**: M.O.N.K.Y never has access to your private keys. They are generated and stored exclusively on your device.
</Warning>

#### Key Generation
- **Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generation**: Using `crypto.getRandomValues()` for true randomness
- **BIP39 Mnemonic Support**: Standard 12/24-word recovery phrases
- **Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets**: BIP44 compliant derivation paths
- **Multiple Account Support**: Generate unlimited accounts from a single seed phrase

#### Key Storage
- **Browser Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage using Web Crypto API
- **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration**: Support for hardware wallets like Ledger
- **Local Encryption**: Keys are encrypted with device-specific entropy before storage
- **No Cloud Storage**: Keys are never synchronized or backed up to cloud services

### üèóÔ∏è **Multi-Signature Support**

<Info>
Multi-signature wallets require multiple signatures to authorize transactions, providing an additional layer of security for high-value accounts.
</Info>

#### Supported Configurations
- **2-of-2 Multi-sig**: Requires both parties to sign transactions
- **2-of-3 Multi-sig**: Any 2 out of 3 parties can authorize transactions  
- **3-of-5 Multi-sig**: Any 3 out of 5 parties can authorize transactions
- **Custom Configurations**: Flexible threshold signatures for enterprise use

#### Use Cases
- **Business Accounts**: Require approval from multiple team members
- **Family Accounts**: Shared control between family members
- **Trust Funds**: Multiple trustees required for withdrawals
- **DAO Treasury**: Decentralized governance for organization funds

### üîí **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

Add an extra layer of security with multiple 2FA options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="App-based 2FA">
    **Supported Apps:**
    - Google Authenticator
    - Authy
    - Microsoft Authenticator

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SMS 2FA">
    **Features:**
    - Global SMS support
    - Multiple phone number backup
    - Rate limiting for security
    - Fallback options available

    **Security Note:**
    SMS 2FA is convenient but less secure than app-based 2FA due to potential SIM swapping attacks.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Hardware Keys">
    **Supported Standards:**
    - FIDO2/WebAuthn
    - U2F (Universal 2nd Factor)
