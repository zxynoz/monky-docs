# Staking

Maximize your SOL holdings by participating in Solana's Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. M.O.N.K.Y makes staking simple, secure, and profitable with our integrated staking platform.

## What is Staking?

Staking is the process of delegating your SOL tokens to validators who help secure the Solana network. In return, you earn staking rewards proportional to your stake amount.

## How Staking Works

### The Staking Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Validator">
    Select from our curated list of high-performance validators
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delegate SOL">
    Delegate your SOL tokens to your chosen validator
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Earn Rewards">
    Receive staking rewards distributed every epoch (~2 days)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compound Growth">
    Rewards are automatically restaked to maximize returns
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Epochs">
    **Duration:** ~2 days (432,000 slots)
    
    • Staking rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch
    • Delegations become active after 1-2 epochs
    • Undelegations have a cooldown period of 1 epoch
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validators">
    **Network Operators**
    
    • Run nodes that process transactions and secure the network
    • Commission rates typically range from 5-10%
    • Performance affects your staking rewards
    • Can be delinquent or miss blocks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rewards">
    **Passive Income**
    
    • Based on network inflation and validator performance
    • Distributed automatically to your stake account
    • Compound automatically unless manually withdrawn
    • Subject to validator commission fees
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slashing">

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Start with small amounts to learn the staking process, then gradually increase your stakes as you become more comfortable with the mechanics and validator selection.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Important:** Always keep some SOL unstaked in your wallet to pay for transaction fees. Staked SOL cannot be used for fees.
